# Hand-Written-Digits-Recognition-System-Using-Pytorch

## General Goals of The Project:
1. Start to learn deep learning by hands on experience
2. Publish it as an achievement
3. Help others who are in the same place as mine

## Technical Goals of The Project:
1. Start to Pytorch
2. Implementing Neural Networks
3. Using Matplotlib and Numpy
4. Building a Digit Recognizer using the mentioned above tools.

## How to Approch This Respiratory: 
. Enter to the Jupyter Notebook File file and Start from There

## Project's Specifications:
. The neural networks training is done by training the netwrok over a 100 epochs
. The netwroks is consiting of 28*28 input neurons ,followed by 64 neurons, followed by 32 neurons, followed by 16 neurons, and finally followed by 10 neurons which represents the probability of each digit to be true.
. The used loss function is: Cross Entropy
. The used optimzer is: Adam Optimizer
. The training dataset is the MNIST dataset which consits of 60,000 labled grayscale photos which size is 28 pixels by 28 pixles of hand written digits.
. The testing dataset is the MNIST dataset which consits of 10,000 labled grayscale photos which size is 28 pixels by 28 pixles of hand written digits.

## The Achieved Results:
. The project achieved an accuracy of 96% over the testing set using a training of 100 epochs.
